					<h2 class="redacted">Research Interests</h2>
					<p align="justify">My current research interest lies in the area of drug delivery and its applications to improve global healthcare. In particular, I have a strong interest in developing cost-effective drugs and novel drug delivery strategies, which will enhance the vaccination and treatment of major diseases including liver diseases, human immunodeficiency virus infection / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) etc. Innovative stretagies employing pharmaceutical and immunological approaches will be undertaken to achieve this goal.</p>

						In this project, we are designing, developing, characterizing, and implementing innovative intravaginal ring (IVR) microbicides for HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or as a vaginal mucosal vaccination platform for other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). As a multidisciplinary project, techniques range from pharmaceutical scicences, cellular and molecular biology, bio-engineering, biomaterials, to immunology are widely utilized to optimize our system.</p>

						The goal for the this project was to explore the novel anti-oxidative function of liver-fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In particular, we focused on utilizing a cell culture model to study whether elevated L-FABP expression is a potential protective intervention for conteracting the oxidative stress observed in liver cells challenged in high fat environment <i>in vitro</i>.</p>

					<h2 class="redacted">Brief Bio</h2>
					<p align="justify"> Yufei Chen, born in Chongqing/P.R.China, received his B.S. in Pharmacy Engineering from the Jilin University (China) in 2007. In 2009, he was accepted as a M.Sc. student under the supervision of Dr. Frank J. Burczynski, during which he obtained the vision in the field of liver disease and received cell/molecular biology training. After obtaining his M.Sc. degree from University of Manitoba in 2011, he joined Dr. Emmanual A. Ho's group, where he was promoted to the field of pharmaceutical sciences, aiming at the development of innovative intravaginal microbicides against HIV-1 infection. Currently, he is a senior member in the Laboratory of Drug Delivery and Biomaterials at the Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Manitoba.
					</br></br>
					Yufei has received a number of awards for his excellent academic and scientific research performance, including <a href="http://mhrc.mb.ca/funding-opportunities/recipients/profile/?id=263" target="_blank">Manitoba Health Research Council - Faculty of Pharmacy Coordinated Studentship</a>, MPhA / William G. Eamer Graduate Scholarship in Pharmacy, University of Manitoba Graduate Fellowship, and International Graduate Student Entrance Scholarship. </p>
