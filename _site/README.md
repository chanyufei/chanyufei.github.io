Bretty
======

Bretty is a simple and pretty Jekyll theme. Wanna see a demo? [here](http://imwithye.github.io)

![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/imwithye/Bretty/master/images/screenshot.jpg)

The theme is mobile optimised but I did not check browser compatibility. It looks great in Chrome, Safari and Firefox though.

### Get started

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/imwithye/Bretty/fork).
2. Clone the repository to your computer.<br /> `https://github.com/imwithye/Bretty`
3. **Using older versions of Jekyll**<br />
  Build and run jekyll using `jekyll --server --auto`.<br />
  **Using [Jekyll 1.0](http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/05/06/jekyll-1-dot-0-released/)**<br />
  Build Jekyll using `jekyll build`.<br />
  Then run Jekyll using `jekyll serve --watch`, go to http://localhost:4000 for your site.

### Make it yours

1. Edit _config.yml, add your own site title, description, email, etc.
2. Change _includes/UserBio.html, your profile goes there
3. For domain settings, see [the guide from GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages).

### Options

When writing a post, there are 3 options you can add to the header.

1. **date**: 2013-05-06 18:07:17<br />
  Date is not a required header since Jekyll reads the file name for date, this was added in only for the **signoff time**. (as shown at the end of this post) If you don't want the signoff time, go into `/_layouts/post.html` remove specific tag.
  
2. **description**: post description goes here<br/>
  You can add post description with this tag. Long description is not advised.
  
3. **author**: Tom<br/>
  The default author will be set by the user_name in _config.yml file. But you still can reset the post author with author tag.
