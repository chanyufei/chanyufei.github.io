Finally, I decided to mirgrate my pure html website to [Jekyll][jekyll] but not [Wordpress][wordpress]. It is not only because of the rapid static experience using pure html but less messy work that I have to do to organize the codes. It's just so hard to give up using pure html coding, I must admit. 

I like the freedom that pure html codes provide.
